*Notes
Common error:
    java.sql.SQLException: The server time zone value 'PDT' is unrecognized or represents more than one time zone. You must 
    configure either the server or JDBC driver (via the serverTimezone configuration property) to use a more specific time zone 
    value if you want to utilize time zone support.copy


Fix by appending time zone information on the end of your MySQL URL:
    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/book-schema?serverTimezone=UTCcopy


Depending on what version you are using you may see a deprecation warning:
    Loading class `com.mysql.jdbc.Driver'. This is deprecated. The new driver class is `com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver'. The driver is automatically registered via the SPI and manual loading of the driver class is generally unnecessary.copy


You may safely remove this setting
    spring.datasource.driver-class-name=com.mysql.jdbc.Driver
