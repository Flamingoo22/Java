Performance: Object types are an instance of a class. They usually hold data and methods. 
                Therefore, their memory capacity is much bigger than their primitive counterpart.

null values: Primitive data types can only hold data. 
                However, Object types are pointers to where the data is stored. 
                This means that this pointer can point to nothing (null), while primitive types cannot.
