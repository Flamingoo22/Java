Java is a complied, platform independent language

Java's design patterns..
    Java is object-oriented
    Java is loosely coupled
        more flexible in design

Interpreted Languages
    benefits:
        More flexible
        Dynamic Typing
        Shorter source-code, easier to write
        platform independent
    Drawbacks:
        Shower, less efficient

Complied Languages
    benefits:
        faster, more efficient
        greater control over memory usage & resources
    Drawbacks:
        Platform dependent
        More involved syntax and code considerations for developers

Java is statically typed language

Java is platform independent
JDK : java development kit
JRE : java runtime environment

Java code > javac (complier) > bytecode > JVM

wrapper class is an object type or class that has greater functionality than its associated primitive type.
