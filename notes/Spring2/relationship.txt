Annotations Used
@OneToOne: Defines the 1:1 relationship with another entity. There are different options that you can have in the annotation and it is extremely important that you use the correct one depending on which side of the relationship your entity is.
@OneToOne(mappedBy="person"): This will map the license attribute in the Person class to the person attribute in the License class. It represents the field that owns the relationship. This element is only specified on the inverse (non-owning) side of the association.
@OneToOne(cascade=CascadeType.ALL): The operations that must be cascaded to the target of the association. This will make sure referential integrity is preserved in ALL actions.
@OneToOne(fetch=FetchType.LAZY): Whether the association should be lazily loaded or must be eagerly fetched.
LAZY: The association is fetched when needed
EAGER: The association is fetched immediately.
There are a few other options that you can have. We encourage you to visit the useful link for the 1:1 relationship.
@JoinColumn(name="person_id"): Defines mapping for composite foreign keys. It indicates that the corresponding table to this entity has a foreign_key to the referenced table.
