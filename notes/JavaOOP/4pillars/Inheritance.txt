Inheritance
Inheritance is the idea that we pass along attributes and methods from one class into a "sub-class" or child class, and not have to re-write the code to make it work. Child classes can be more specific versions of their Parent class. Using the key word "super" will call methods


class CappuccinoMaker extends CoffeeMaker {
    
    public CappuccinoMaker(int maxVolumeOz) {
        super(maxVolumeOz);
        this.milk = "whole";
    }
    
    public void makeCappuccino(String beans) {
        super.brew(beans);
        System.out.println("Smooth.");
    }
}
