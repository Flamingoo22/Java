Polymorphism
Polymorphism means "many forms", and the idea in OOP is that a Child class can have a different version of a method than the Parent class. 

class CappuccinoMaker extends CoffeeMaker {
 
    public CappuccinoMaker() {
        this.maxVolumeOz = 16;
        this.milk = "whole";
    }
                  
    public void brew(="operator from-rainbow">="entity class from-rainbow">String beans) {
	super.brew(beans);
        System.out.println("Frothy!!!");
    }
                  
    public void clean(){
        System.out.println("Cleaning the froth!");
    }
}
