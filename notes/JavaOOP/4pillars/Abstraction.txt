Abstraction
Abstraction is an extension of Encapsulation, and we can hide attributes or methods that a Barista doesn't need to know about


class Barista {
    
    private String name;
    private CoffeeMaker coffeeMaker;
    
    public Barista(String name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.coffeeMaker = new CoffeeMaker(40);
    }
    
    public void makeCoffee() {
        this.coffeeMaker.brew();
    }
}
